# Multiple-Disease-Prediction-Web-App
 Built a Streamlit-based healthcare assistant to predict Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinsonâ€™s using machine learning models.

 - Tools & technologies used: Streamlit, Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Pickle), Data Wrangling, Machine Learning
 - Developed an end-to-end ML application with dynamic user inputs and real-time disease risk prediction.
 - Trained and deployed classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest) on medical datasets.
 - Applied data preprocessing and feature engineering to enhance prediction accuracy and interpretability.
 - Integrated trained models into a user-friendly web interface, enabling interactive health diagnostics.
